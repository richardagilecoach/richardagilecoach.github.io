## TLDR

I am an experiened Delivery Shaped Person in the UK Civil Service. I often work in complex programmes, with competing priorities, internal conflicts and eye-watering stakeholder environments, helping those teams improve their process and work over time. I deliver, facilitate, coach, train and support senior leadership, teams and individuals across the globe to transform in the pursuit of value using Scrum, Kanban, LeSS, Lean, Post-its and good coffee, on my journey to Certified Team Coach with the Scrum Alliance. I also keep bees and live in the glorious South West near the beach :-)

### More about me

After setting off in Geography teaching after university then finding Project Management over 12 years ago, I then started to use and develop a range of agile techniques in different innovative boutique digital agencies across the UK. I helped them to launch film programmes with the Coop, smooth hair-free legs with Veet Reckit Benckiser and kept dogs pain-free around the world in 17 languages on 5 different platforms with a global pharmaceutical company. 

Moving into the public sector some four years ago, I work in a multi-disciplinary Agile delivery team tailoring techniques to deliver software and hardware projects for a technical organisation in the Civil Service. It has a range of national agencies, global partners and different timezones, working in a complex arena.

As part of the Agile function in the organisation, I was chosen to trial a formal Agile coaching pathway, accruing certification like a junior swimmer, on a journey from CSM to Certified Team Coach, via Lean Kanban, LeSS and SAFe, now providing agile coaching to thousands of colleagues across the sector on my journey to Certified Team Coach with the Scrum Alliance. I also help run a range of internal events, workshops, training courses and also setup an internal two day Agile Conference for those in our sector to share good practice and inspire Agile development. 

Working in different consultancies at a Principal level means I don't just deliver, I get to set up and develop Communities of Practice, Delivery Academies and Centres of Excellence for all things Delivery, Agile, Scrum and Product.I have atrack record of leading operational projects and strategies, and driving digital change and transformation projects to support growth and performance of businesses within non-profit and private sectors. My experience includes working with clients to establish organisational goals and needs; building and upskilling empowered, high performing teams through discovery, design, build through to launch; whilst strategically supporting cultural and processual business changes throughout. Whatever that means :-) 

When I am not doing that, I am also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a 4th Generation Beekeeper, that is now allergic to bee and wasp stings. I live in the glorious South West with my family near the beach and one day, one day...I will learn how to surf :-)
