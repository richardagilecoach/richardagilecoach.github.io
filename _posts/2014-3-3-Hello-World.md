Thanks for dropping by. 

This is my WIP website, where I gather my thoughts on all things Agile and Coaching. Please read a bit more [about me](/about "read more about me here") or [check out my blog](/blog "browse my latest blog posts") for my latest thoughts. Give me a shout on any of the networks below if you have any questions or want to chat. I am based in Bude, Cornwall in the lovely South West of the UK. It's lovely here, drop in and say hi when you get a moment :-)

Yours, Richard
