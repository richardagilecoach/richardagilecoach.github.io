**TL;DR**  
There didn't seem to be a community to support those that are responsible for groups of delivery folks, so I set one up. Advice, guidance, support and connections. Please join if that sounds useful or share it with a friend you know too!

**Your takeaway**:  A free online community with some IRL meetups when we can?...WHERE DO I SIGN! [Right here](https://forms.gle/FNkCHjr9NnQ2awxNA). üôÇ

## Why did you set this up then Richard?

Hello. You okay? **You sure?** All good? Well, that‚Äôs great to hear. Glad to hear it‚Äôs going well today. The one thing you can be sure of though, is that you will hit a bump in the road at some point. And when you do, who do you turn to for support, guidance, help, maybe some inspiration?

It‚Äôs hard when you are responsible for a Delivery Group. Are you a *Head of Delivery, Delivery Director, possibly even a Chief Delivery Officer if that‚Äôs a thing?* It‚Äôs such a specialist role and most of the time you are probably busy fire fighting rather than searching for new things to put on your Senior Delivery Manager skills pathway or your competency framework.

Well, don't panic. Okay, not immediately. The Hod Squad is here for you. Because I have just set it up and I want you to join. Please üôÇ

### Sounds good, I am IN! How's it going to work then?
Well fear not, the Hod Squad is here for you. If you want it. It‚Äôs an online community with some IRL get togethers, to make sure you feel part of the human race still. It‚Äôs full of those that either run delivery groups or those that work closely with them like me. Advice, guidance, inspiration, support and connections. If that sounds up your street or good for somebody you know, head to the sign up form and see you there! Right, back to the inbox of joy. Have a good one!

### What's involved do you think?
I'm not sure. That's filing you with confidence isn't it? Well, what I mean is, I don't know yet. But I hope to soon, after doing a few research interviews with some ~~unlucky~~ lucky friends and connections I already have. I am trying to work out what people might get value from, including:

 - **Online bits**
	 - What tool is best? Another Slack, Discord or similar?
	 - Do you want an email newsletter / podcast / monthly post / pigeon post / temp tattoos / stickers?
	 - Are talks / guest spots handy for you?
 - **Your big three**
	 - What are the three most important things you are struggling with at the moment that we can help you with, which you don't mind sharing?
 - **IRL things**
	 - What location is easy for you to get to?
	 - How often would these be useful for you?
	 - What times of day are best for you, to fit in with other things you have to get done in your day?
 - **What can you offer...**
	 - ..the community, a technique, template or useful phrase?
 - **and what can I offer you...**
	 - in return. Do you need a workshop, handy GIF or something I haven't thought of? LET ME KNOW!
